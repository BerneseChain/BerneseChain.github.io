<p>Welcome to our website. $BERNESE is a native dog token secured by the Osmosis blockchain and distributed to lovers of meme dog money, similar to the original spirit and maintenance of the $DOGE blockchain.
  
<h1>The Bernese Chain Manifesto</h1>
We are Bernese Dog ($BERNESE)<p>

We welcome people into the cosmosis hub.<p>

We value:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Being robust, we value openness over product shipping.</li>
<li>Being simple, we value genuine simplicity.</li>
<li>Being welcoming, we value making friends and building trust with everyone.</li>
<li>Being authentic, we value people and interactions over profit-driven economics.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Bernese Mountain Dogs generally have a friendly and laid-back temperament.

<h1>Two coins starting with B</h1>

<p>Same as BTC, $BERNESE remains liquid and does not demand too much movement. There's no need to bailout any development activities by using Community Pool Spends. In fact, there's no Dev Fund or Community Pool. All the tokens are in possession of random airdropped participants / holders and no more $BERNESE can be printed ever.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>White paper</h2>
<p>The genesis document: "<a href="https://medium.com/@bernesechain/proposed-distribution-for-a-dog-token-8bab3614b393">Proposed distribution for a dog token</a>", lists all the activities performed for the airdrop, token distribution, minting rights burned and allocation cheese diagrams.</p>

<h2>Is there a cap?</h2>

<br>
<p>Supply is limited to 132 Million Bernese. <a href="https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/tx/5CF85F649CE444FE8616189A636CB43BE2DE83F97A6035FF4CD1F960335C047B?height=15057289">Minting rights have been burned.</a></p>
<br>
<h2>Why donâ€™t the devs burn some of the supply?</h2>
<p><a href="https://dogecoin.com/dogepedia/faq/dogecoin-and-coin-burning/">Bernese and coin burning</a></p>

<h2>What can I do with my $BERNESE?</h2>
<p>Just hold it.</p>
<p>Another revenue activity is to pool $BERNESE together with $WBTC (<a href="https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/2038">in pool 2038</a>), with $wstETH (<a href="https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/2037">in pool 2037</a>), with Gold ($PAXG) (<a href="https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/3001">in pool 3001</a>), with USD (<a href="https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/2239">in pool 2239</a>) or even get better APRs by predicting closer ranges of sideway moves within the USD concentrated liquidity pool (<a href="https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/2178">in pool 2178</a>).</p>
<p>This is the only fair activity for a dog token, as it requires the least amount of attention, user's money is unlocked all the time, and anybody can come and go anytime.</p>

<h2>Is it safe? Will it be swept by a single user?</h2>
<p>5% of the supply on the moment of the creation was paired with 6100 $OSMO and <a href="https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/tx/D526CCF669311A84326D0CB1C6A214D57D1757421BD349EDFFE9EB1BCF02A015?height=15161370">sent to an inaccessible wallet (burn address).</a></p>
<p>Airdrop has been thoroughly checked and 110000 addresses were eligible with different allocations. Largest known whale owns 0.46% of the supply.</p>
<p>34% of the supply, as of today (August 2025), has been paired with diversified assets</p>

<h2>What's $BERNESE added value?</h2>
Bernese's value is intangible and subjective. Members of the community have given value to different factors:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Community is humble: The airdrop depended on a very wide group of people giving support to a chain that was about to close (proportionally to their stakes).</li>
<li>It is just a large breed dog token and might appeal to users that appreciate dogs justs as they are.</li>
<li>Dog breed is funny and many memes can come over the years.</li>
<li>Every piece of documentation is copyleft and open source, starting from the logo. Authorship reference rights are for 'Bernese Chain Community'</li>
<li>There are no founders or gimmicks to artificially play with the price. Creator has no control anymore of the token and has low allocation just as any other user.</li>
<li>Social media channels will never ping, or search for attention.</li>
<li>Any participant puts their free time: There's no community pool and no need to pay validators, creating NFT's, games, community moderators, lockings, burns or announcements without substance.</li>
<li>No risks of bugs, chain halts or IBC channel closures, since Osmosis is a very well maintained chain.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h2>Where is the liquidity located?</h2>
<p>Liquidity can be found in Osmosis, in pools <a href="https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/2038">2038</a>, <a href="https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/1700">1700</a>, <a href="https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/2037">2037</a>, <a href="https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/2039">2039</a>, <a href="https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/2239">2239</a>, <a href="https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/2178">2178</a>.</p>

<h2>Why no staking, locking, incentives or inflation?</h2>
<p>The token depends on the security provided by Osmosis. On each transaction, the user will pay small $osmo tx fees for transfers, swaps or adding liquidity to the pools.</p>
<p>


<h2>Is this coin a joke?</h2>
<p>Yes. Memecoins have been lately too serious about having 'utility', being 'trendy' or "meme picture", this drags their resources.</p>
<p>Bernese is just a dog breed and allows the community to use some creativity.</p>
